    <h3 style="color: red;"><strong><u>History Of GIT</u></strong></h3>
     <p>Git, the widely used distributed version control system, was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system kernel. 
        The catalyst for its creation was a licensing dispute surrounding BitKeeper, a proprietary DVCS that the Linux kernel project had been using since 2002. 
        When free access to BitKeeper was revoked, the Linux development community needed a new solution.</p>
    <p>Torvalds set out to design a new version control system with several key goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Speed:</b> Efficiently handle large projects like the Linux kernel with thousands of commits.</li>
        <li><b>Distributed Architecture:</b> Every developer should possess a full copy of the repository, enabling offline work and robust backup.</li>
        <li><b>Data Integrity:</b> Ensure the secure and reliable tracking of changes throughout the project's history.</li>
        <li><b>Support for Non-linear Development:</b> Facilitate easy branching and merging for complex, parallel development workflows.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Development of Git began on April 3, 2005, and Torvalds announced the project on April 6. The system quickly became self-hosting, and by April 29, it was managing the Linux kernel source code.
        Git was formally released as version 1.0 on December 21, 2005, with Junio Hamano taking over as the lead maintainer from Torvalds in July of that year. </p>
    <p>Git's distributed nature and emphasis on speed, data integrity, and flexible branching and merging capabilities quickly led to its widespread adoption, making it the most dominant version control 
        system in use today for both open-source and commercial software projects.</p>
